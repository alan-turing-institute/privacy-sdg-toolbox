# privacy-sdg-toolbox

Evaluating the privacy of synthetic data with an adversarial toolobox.

## Direct Installation

### Requirements
The framework and its building blocks have been developed and tested under Python 3.9.


#### Poetry installation
To mimic our environment exactly, we recommend using `poetry`. To install poetry (system-wide), follow the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

Then run
```
poetry install
```
from inside the project directory. This will create a virtual environment (default `.venv`), that can be accessed by running `poetry shell`, or in the usual way (with `source .venv/bin/activate`).
