"""
This file implements common examples of attacker knowledge of both the
private dataset and the generator. This specifies elements (2.) and (3.)
of threat models (see .base_classes.py).

Knowledge of the data is represented by AttackerKnowledgeOnData objects,
which defines methods to sample training and testing datasets.

Knowledge of the generator is represented by AttackerKnowledgeOnGenerator
objects, which is primarily a wrapper of generator.__call__ with a given
number of synthetic records, but can be extended to more.
